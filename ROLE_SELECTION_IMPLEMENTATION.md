# Google OAuth Role Selection Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Google OAuth authentication with role selection for job seekers and employers, featuring separate dashboards with UUID tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Google OAuth Role Selection Flow
- **New User Experience**: When users sign up with Google OAuth, they are redirected to a role selection page
- **Role Options**: 
  - Job Seeker (role: 'user') → Redirects to `/jobseeker`
  - Employer (role: 'employer') → Redirects to `/hire`
- **Existing User Experience**: Existing users are redirected directly to their appropriate dashboard

### 2. Role-Specific Dashboards

#### Job Seeker Dashboard (`/jobseeker`)
- **Features**:
  - Job application statistics (Applied Jobs, Saved Jobs, Profile Views, Interviews)
  - Quick actions (Search Jobs, Update Profile, Upload Resume, Job Alerts)
  - Recent activity feed
  - Recommended jobs section
- **UUID Display**: Shows unique user ID for tracking
- **Access Control**: Only accessible by users with 'user' role

#### Employer Dashboard (`/hire`)
- **Features**:
  - Hiring statistics (Active Jobs, Applications, Interviews, Hired Candidates)
  - Quick actions (Post New Job, Search Candidates, View Applications, Company Profile)
  - Recent activity feed
  - Active job listings management
  - Top candidates section
- **UUID Display**: Shows unique company ID for tracking
- **Access Control**: Only accessible by users with 'employer' role

### 3. Enhanced User Model
- **UUID Field**: Added unique UUID field to User model using `uuid` package
- **OAuth Support**: Maintains existing Google OAuth integration
- **Role Management**: Supports 'user', 'employer', and 'admin' roles

### 4. API Endpoints

#### `/api/user/update-role` (POST)
- Updates user role after selection
- Protected endpoint requiring authentication
- Validates role values ('user' or 'employer')

#### `/api/user/me` (GET)
- Fetches current user data including UUID
- Returns user profile information
- Used by dashboards to display user-specific data

### 5. Authentication Flow Updates

#### NextAuth Configuration
- **New User Detection**: Added `isNewUser` flag to identify first-time Google users
- **Callback Updates**: Modified JWT and session callbacks to handle role selection flow
- **Redirect Logic**: Automatic redirection based on user status and role

#### Sign-in/Sign-up Pages
- **Modern UI**: Clerk-like design with gradient backgrounds and improved styling
- **Password Visibility**: Toggle for password fields
- **Google OAuth**: Seamless integration with role selection for new users
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and user feedback

### 6. Routing and Security

#### Middleware Protection
- Protected routes: `/jobseeker`, `/hire`, `/admin`, `/auth/select-role`
- Role-based access control
- Authentication requirement enforcement

#### Dashboard Redirection
- **Legacy Dashboard**: `/dashboard` now redirects to appropriate role-specific dashboard
- **Navbar Updates**: Dynamic dashboard links based on user role
- **Session Management**: Proper role validation and redirection

### 7. UI/UX Improvements

#### Role Selection Page
- **Beautiful Design**: Modern card-based interface with radio button selections
- **Clear Options**: Distinct job seeker vs employer paths
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded selections and hover states
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and loading indicators

#### Dashboard Designs
- **Modern Layout**: Card-based design with statistics and quick actions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **User Feedback**: Clear role indicators and user information display

## Technical Implementation

- `/app/dashboard/page.js` - Redirect to role-specific dashboards
- `/components/Navbar.js` - Dynamic dashboard links
- `/middleware.js` - Protected routes and access control

### Dependencies Added:

## User Flow Examples

### New Google OAuth User:
1. Clicks "Continue with Google" on sign-in/sign-up page
2. Completes Google authentication
3. Redirected to `/auth/select-role` page
4. Selects "Find Jobs" or "Hire Talent"
5. Role is saved to database
6. Redirected to `/jobseeker` or `/hire` dashboard

### Existing User:
1. Signs in with Google or email/password
2. Automatically redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
3. No role selection needed

### Role-Specific Features:
- **Job Seekers**: Can search/apply for jobs, manage profile, track applications
- **Employers**: Can post jobs, review applications, search candidates
- **Admins**: Access to admin dashboard with user management

## Security Features
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware prevents unauthorized access
- **Role Validation**: Server-side role verification
- **Session Management**: Secure NextAuth session handling
- **UUID Tracking**: Unique identifiers for audit trails

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. **Job Posting System**: Full CRUD for job listings
2. **Application System**: Job application submission and management
3. **Search & Filtering**: Advanced job/candidate search
4. **Messaging System**: Communication between employers and job seekers
5. **Profile Completion**: Detailed profile forms for both user types
6. **File Upload**: Resume/document upload functionality
7. **Email Notifications**: Job alerts and application updates

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a professional job portal with role-based functionality and modern user experience.

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- Enhanced dashboard with new profile sections
- Integrated with existing `UserProfile` component
- Uses existing API endpoints (`/api/user/me`, `/api/user/profile`)
- Heroicons for consistent iconography

- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized for multiple entries

```bash
node test-enhanced-profile.js
```

Or test manually:
1. Navigate to `/jobseeker`
2. Check Dashboard tab for new sections
3. Test with different data scenarios
4. Verify empty states and overflow handling
